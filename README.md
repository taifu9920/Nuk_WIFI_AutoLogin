# Nuk_WIFI_AutoLogin
###An APP design for auto login dormitory wifi in NUK
***
For now, **this release only support auto login OA_2F WIFI**.
In future I'll make an advance setting for more different WIFI names.
Since I cannot go all the college to collect the WIFI informations,
I'll design this into a setting to add WIFI names, and their login IP Address,
If I can done more I would try letting it search for it's login IP Address,
***
Currently, this Application only supports **Android 8(API Level 26)** to **Android 11(API level 30)**
And only been tested in **Android 10**,
If anyone encounter problems in those version,
Please make a report it to me for debug and fix that.
